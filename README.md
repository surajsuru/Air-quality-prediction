# Air-quality-prediction


This Python script predicts the quality of air pollution by combining the predictions from linear regression and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

 The code first loads the training and testing data, then extracts features and target labels from the training set.

After standardizing the features, it trains a logistic regression model and an ANN model on the training data. Subsequently, it predicts the target labels for the testing data using both models. 

Finally, it calculates the average of the predictions from both models and output the result
